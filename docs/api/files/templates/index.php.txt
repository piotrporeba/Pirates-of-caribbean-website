<h2><em>The leader in fitness!</em></h2>
<p>
The Powerhouse Gym name and brand has been one of the top leaders in the fitness industry for over 35 years.
With 300 licensees in 39 states, Powerhouse has continued to steadily gain global attention by expanding
into 17 different countries worldwide. The first Powerhouse Gym still stands in its original location
and celebrated its 35th anniversary in 2010.<br>

The Powerhouse Gym name and logo provides its gyms instant recognition and credibility associated with
an internationally registered trademark and service mark symbolic with quality in the health and fitness
industry.<br>

Today, Powerhouse Gyms International is in the midst of tremendous growth and expansion.
One reason for this surge in membership and facilities has been Powerhouse Gym's ability to not only
accommodate the conditioned market, but to also attract mainstream consumers and fitness enthusiast by
providing excellent fitness facilities.<br>

The famous muscleman logo is a sign of credibility across the country and is a testament of where this
company began. The Powerhouse Gym Trademark is associated with service and quality, and is apparent
throughout each and every Powerhouse Gym that opens its doors to over 1.5 million dedicated members.<br>

It is not uncommon to see an A-list celebrity training at Powerhouse Gym, including such stars as Arnold Schwarzenegger,
Cameron Diaz, John Travolta, Jerome "The Bus" Bettis, Alex Rodriguez, Mike Tyson and Dwayne "The Rock"
Johnson, to name a few.<br>

<h2> <em>The History</em> </h2>
<p>
Founded in 1975 by brothers, William and Norman Dabish, the health club chain, which began as a single
inner-city establishment in Highland Park, Michigan, has grown into one of the most well-known and well
respected health club organizations in the world. The Powerhouse Gym name and brand has been one of the
top leaders in the fitness industry for over 35 years. With 300 licensees in 39 states, Powerhouse has
continued to steadily gain global attention by expanding into 17 different countries worldwide.
The first Powerhouse Gym still stands in its original location and celebrated its 35th anniversary in
2010.<br><br>

Due to the overwhelming success of its original facilities and the demand that they created for additional
out-of-state locations, a Licensing Division was formed in 1984. Today, as stated in the recent report
published by the health and fitness advocacy organization IHRSA, the Powerhouse Gym Trademark and Service
Marks are amongst the most recognized brands in the health and fitness industry. Seven of every ten people
in the United States recognize the Powerhouse Gym logo and/or insignia.<br>
